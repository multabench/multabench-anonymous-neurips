Description:
Consumer Complaints Dataset This dataset contains records of consumer complaints filed against financial service
companies, featuring structured fields such as product type, state, and submission method, alongside rich textual
attributes like sub-product, issue, sub-issue, and company name. The prediction target is the company's response to the
complaint, consolidated into four meaningful classes: CLOSED WITH EXPLANATION, CLOSED WITH NON-MONETARY
RELIEF, CLOSED WITH MONETARY RELIEF, AND CLOSED WITHOUT RELIEF. This focused setup maintains a
challenging multi-class classification task while allowing for a fair assessment of how textual embeddings can enhance
tabular model performance in real-world customer service scenarios. The original dataset has approx. 1.42m rows,
which we randomly downsample to 100k to include a fair representation of rare classes while keeping the size feasible
for training.


About Dataset
Context

With the aim to classify future complaints based on its content, we used different machine learning algorithms can make more accurate predictions (i.e., classify the complaint in one of the product categories)
