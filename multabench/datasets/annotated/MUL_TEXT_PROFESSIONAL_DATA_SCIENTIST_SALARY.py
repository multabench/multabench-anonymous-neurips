Description: salary: Predict the salary range listed in data scientist job postings (in India) given the job description
    as well as other features like skill requirements and location. Intuitively, the best models will learn to
    identify valuable requirements from the text and high salary locations (via categorical modeling)
    as well as predictive interaction-effects. Representing a task with many text fields, this dataset
    originally stems from a 2018 MachineHack prediction competition: https://machinehack.com/hackathons/predict_the_data_scientists_salary_in_india_hackathon/overview
  
 Dataset found from the paper: Benchmarking multimodal automl for tabular data with text fields. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02705.
